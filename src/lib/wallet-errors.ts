/**
 * Turns whatever a wallet, an injected provider, or the GenLayer client throws into a sentence a
 * person can read.
 *
 * None of those are guaranteed to throw a real `Error`. EIP-1193 providers routinely reject with
 * a plain `{ code, message, data }` object, and viem/genlayer-js wrap those again in their own
 * plain objects with `shortMessage`/`cause`/`details`. `error instanceof Error ? error.message :
 * String(error)` treats every one of those as "not an Error" and falls through to `String(...)`,
 * which on a plain object is always the literal text `[object Object]` — a real message that a
 * person could act on, replaced by four words that describe nothing. Register Participant showed
 * exactly that this session: the thrown value was `{code: -32601, message: "method
 * [wallet_getSnaps] doesn't has corresponding handler", data: {...}}`, a wallet's own words about
 * a real problem, discarded.
 *
 * A rejection code of 4001 (EIP-1193's "user rejected the request") is not a fault in this app or
 * the contract, so it gets its own calm sentence rather than whatever wording the wallet chose.
