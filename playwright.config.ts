/**
 * End-to-end smoke tests against the deployed site, not a local dev server.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `webServer` here. A local `next dev` would prove the source
 * builds, which `npm run build` already proves. What is not otherwise proven is that the
 * thing on the internet is in live mode, is pointed at the contract this commit claims,
 * and renders a record that really exists on StudioNet. Only the deployed origin can
 * answer that, so that is what these tests open.
 *
 * `E2E_BASE_URL` overrides the origin, for running the same suite against a preview
 * deployment before promoting it. An empty value is the same as an absent one, because a
 * workflow input that was left blank arrives as "".
 *
 * No test here sends a transaction. The injected wallet the wallet tests install answers
 * `eth_requestAccounts`, `eth_chainId` and `wallet_switchEthereumChain` and throws on
 * everything else, so a signing path cannot be reached even by accident and the suite
 * costs no GEN however often it runs.
